        <br>
        At first, you will have to upload the <a href="{{ url_for('exampletxt') }}" title = "See the example">.txt file</a> with words and their translations in the form. 
        The word and translated word in .txt file have to be in a one line separated by semi-column and 1 space.
        Each 2-tuple of words have to be in new line. At least 5 2-tuples of words should be added.   
        <br><br>
        The set of the words will be stored and after clicking DONE button, the game will start.
        <br>
        Then you will be asked to translate {{ no_of_selected}} randomly chosen words from the set of the words you uploaded. 
        After each right translation, you will gain points. At the end, you will maybe see the summary.
